# BottomSheet

The `BottomSheet` and it's respective components are exports of [`@gorhom/react-native-bottom-sheet`](https://gorhom.github.io/react-native-bottom-sheet/).

You can read more on the [internal `BottomSheet` functionalities here](https://gorhom.github.io/react-native-bottom-sheet). As Bumbag inherits `@gorhom/react-native-bottom-sheet`, it shares the same props, methods and API.
