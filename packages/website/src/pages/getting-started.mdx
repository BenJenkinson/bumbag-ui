# Getting started

Firstly, install Fannypack:

```
npm install fannypack
```

Once you have installed the `fannypack` module, wrap your application in a "`<FannypackProvider>`":

```jsx
import { Provider as FannypackProvider } from 'fannypack';

const App = () => (
  <FannypackProvider>
    Hello world!
  </FannypackProvider>
);
```

Now, you can start using the Fannypack components:

```jsx
import { Button, Provider as FannypackProvider } from 'fannypack';

const MyApp = () => (
  <FannypackProvider>
    <Button>
      Hello world!
    </Button>
  </FannypackProvider>
);
```

> Note: You can override Fannypack's default theme by passing a `theme` prop to `<FannypackProvider>`. [Click here to find out how to add a theme](/theming).
