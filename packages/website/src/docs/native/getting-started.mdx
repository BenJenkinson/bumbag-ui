# Getting started

Firstly, install Bumbag & Bumbag Native:

```
npm install bumbag bumbag-native
```

Once you have installed the modules, wrap your application in a "`<BumbagNativeProvider>`":

```jsx
import { Text, Provider as BumbagNativeProvider } from 'bumbag-native';

const App = () => (
  <BumbagNativeProvider>
    <Text>Hello world!</Text>
  </BumbagNativeProvider>
);
```

Now, you can start using the Bumbag components:

```jsx
import { Button, Provider as BumbagNativeProvider } from 'bumbag-native';

const MyApp = () => (
  <BumbagNativeProvider>
    <Button>
      Hello world!
    </Button>
  </BumbagNativeProvider>
);
```

> Note: You can override Bumbag's default theme by passing a `theme` prop to `<BumbagNativeProvider>`. [Click here to find out how to add a theme](/theming).
